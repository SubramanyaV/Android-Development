Step 1: In activity_name.xml
		-Go to the TextView (or) ImageView (or) Button (or) .....
		-In that View add a statement "android:onClick="some_function_name"
		-Now a Hint appears when we hover the cursor over the function name (bulb)
		-Click the bulb and click the option to "Create function_name(View) in 'class_name_of_that_activity'"
Step 2: Now go to the java file of that activity
		-There already by the name of the function given in the xml file is created
		-Now give the body of that function as
			"Intent obj_name = new Intent (this,$.class);
			 startActivity(obj_name);

obj_name = name of the newly created object of class Intent(Predefined)
This in the syntax is the context
$ = class name of activity to which you whish to navigate to.
